# Configuration Specification

This file serves as a specification for a `skaf` configuration file. All 
authorable options/parameters are documented within this document.

## input

The `input` object contains options for which source files and methods to select
for test generation.

### src

A path specifying directory within which to search. All files within the 
directory will potentially be input files if they match the rules within 
[files](#files).

### files

An array of rules that determine what files within the [src](#src) directory 
will have tests generated for them. Each rule contains an `include` string 
with an optional `exclude` string. The following is an example of such a rule: 
```json
{ include: "**.cs", exclude: "**.g.cs" }
```

The `include` property is a glob string which defines a pattern for which files 
to include for test generation. The above example of such a string is `"**.cs"` 
which selects all files within the [src](#src) folder with a `.cs` extension.

The `exclude` property is a glob string which defines a pattern for which files 
should be excluded from test generation. This will only exclude files that were 
matched by the sibling `include` glob string. This means that this glob string 
will have no effect on files which are matched by `include` glob strings in 
other rules. In the above example, all files with the `.cs` extension are 
included, but files which end in `.g.cs` are excluded (a `.g.cs` extension 
typically indicates the file was generated by some tool and therefore shouldn't 
be tested).
