# Overview

This document serves as a guide to how the `skaf` tool works. The `skaf` tool 
operates in 3 phases: `Input`, `Map`, and `Generate`.

## Input Phase

The purpose of the `Input Phase` is to gather to the data from the source files 
for which tests will be generated. The source files are selected based off of 
the `input` section within the skaf configuration. These files are referred to 
as the `input files` or the `source files`. 

Once the full set of `input files` has been determined, metadata is extracted 
from the files. This metadata includes the classes that are contained within 
the files, and the methods that are contained within those classes. This 
metadata is then passed to the `Map Phase`.

## Map Phase

The purpose of the `Map Phase` is to use the source file metadata generated by 
the `Input Phase`, and translate it into metadata that represents the tests to 
generate. Each `MethodMetadata` object from the source files is translated into 
another `MethodMetadata` object that will eventually become a test file. The 
translation process is controlled by the `map` section within the skaf 
configuration. The `MethodMetadata` objects that are generated by the 
`Map Phase` are passed to the `Generate Phase`.

## Generate Phase

The purpose of the `Generate Phase` is to use the `MethodMetadata` objects 
representing the tests, to create the tests themselves. The creation of the 
tests is controlled by the `generate` section of the skaf configuration. The 
`Generate Phase` creates new test files if need be, and is responsible for 
merging new tests into files that contain existing tests where applicable.
