# Skaf

Skaf is a tool that is meant to automate the process of scaffolding unit tests 
for a .NET Core project. It is intended to be distributed as a .NET Core tool 
but could also include an MSBuildTarget as well. The current use scenario is 
generating XUnit tests for a C# .NET Core project. 

## Who is Skaf For?

Skaff is currently being developed as my personal project because I hate 
writing the method signatures for Unit tests. As such its use case is very 
narrow. After I flesh out my personal use case I'm more than willing to add 
features for other use cases that people might have. This project is primarily 
for my own productivity and the experience of architecting my own project. It 
will likely have a wider appeal in the future as I build it out.

## How Can I Learn How to Use Skaf?

Currently there is no documentation but the source code is relatively straight 
forward. As features become finalized I'll create a GitHub pages site that will 
host the documentation for how to use Skaf. I will also try to develop in app 
help menus to help new users get started fast.

## How Can I Contribute?

Initially I don't want to handle pull requests. Currently I want to get a good 
foundation for the project before I start taking outside code contributions. In 
the mean time feel free to write feature requests or bug reports that you find 
within the current state of the project. As I have time I'll try to address the 
issues that seem that most crucial and popular.
